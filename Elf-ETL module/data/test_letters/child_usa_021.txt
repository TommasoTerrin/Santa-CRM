Dear Santa,

My name is Leo and I am 8 years old. How are you and Mrs. Claus doing? Are the reindeer getting ready for the big night? I hope so!

This year I’ve tried really, really hard to be good. Mostly. I help Mom with the dishes sometimes and I always try to say please and thank you. I know I messed up a few weeks ago when Tommy and I decided to see how high we could stack the cereal boxes in the pantry. It was really high, Santa! Higher than me! But then… well, it all came crashing down and Mom was NOT happy. She said it was a huge mess and a waste of perfectly good Cheerios. I did help clean it up, though!

Anyway, for Christmas this year, I would really, really love a Nintendo Switch. All my friends have one, and we could play Mario Kart together online. That would be SO much fun! Also, if it’s not too much to ask, I’d like the Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga video game for it. And maybe a new Captain America action figure. The one I have, I accidentally broke his arm off when I was trying to make him fly really fast.

I’ll leave you some cookies and milk on Christmas Eve! I hope you like chocolate chip.

Love,
Leo
