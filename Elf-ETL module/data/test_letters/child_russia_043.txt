Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 9 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and my grumpy cat, Boris.

I know you are very busy making toys for all the children in the world, but I hope you have time to read my letter. This year, I have tried to be a good girl. It’s not always easy, especially when Boris steals my crayons! But I always share my candy with my best friend, Dasha, even when I really want to eat it all myself. Last week, Mama asked me to help tidy up my room, and I did it without complaining, even though I wanted to go outside and play in the snow.

For New Year's, I would really, really love a new set of colored pencils, the kind that blend together really smoothly. My old ones are all broken and stubby. I also saw a beautiful doll at the Detsky Mir toy store, the one dressed like a ballerina. She has such a pretty pink tutu! And, if it’s not too much to ask, maybe a new book about horses? I love reading about them.

Thank you, Ded Moroz, for all the joy you bring. Please stay warm on your journey!

With love,
Anya
