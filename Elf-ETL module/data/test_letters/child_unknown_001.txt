Cher Père Noël,

My name is Sophie and I am 9 years old. I live in Paris, France. I hope you are well and that Mrs. Claus is making lots of delicious Christmas cookies!

This year, I have tried my best to be a good girl. I always help Maman with setting the table, and I’ve been practicing my piano every day, even when I’d rather be playing outside with my friends. I even shared my pain au chocolat with my little brother, Antoine, even though it was my favorite! Sometimes I still argue with him, but I'm trying to be nicer.

For Christmas this year, I have three wishes:

1.  A new art set with lots of different colored pencils and paints, so I can draw pictures of the Eiffel Tower and the Seine.
2.  A book about horses! I love horses so much and I want to learn everything about them.
3.  Maybe, just maybe, a little hamster. I promise I will take very good care of it and give it lots of cuddles.

Merci beaucoup, Père Noël! I will leave you some macarons and a glass of milk by the fireplace.

Joyeux Noël!

Love,
Sophie
