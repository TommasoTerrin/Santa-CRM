Dear Santa,

My name is Leo and I'm 8 years old. We live in Ohio. I hope Mrs. Claus and the elves are doing okay! Is Rudolph’s nose extra shiny this year?

I've tried really hard to be good this year. I know I sometimes argue with my little sister, Lily, but I helped her build a really cool Lego castle last week. She kept putting the wrong pieces together, and I could have gotten mad, but I showed her how to read the instructions and we finished it together! She even let me put the little dragon on top.

For Christmas this year, I would really, REALLY love a Nintendo Switch. I've been saving up my allowance, but it's going to take me forever. Also, I would like the new Legend of Zelda game, Tears of the Kingdom, for it. My friend Max has it and it looks super fun.

If that's too much, maybe a Lego Star Wars set? The Millennium Falcon would be awesome, but any one would be great.

Thank you, Santa! I will leave out cookies and milk for you and carrots for the reindeer!

Love,
Leo
