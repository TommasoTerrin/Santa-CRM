Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 7 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and Babushka. I hope the snow is treating you well up in Veliky Ustyug! Mama says you're very busy this time of year, so I'll try to be quick.

This year, I've tried to be a good girl. I helped Babushka in the garden sometimes, pulling weeds, and I even ate all my kasha without complaining (well, almost!). But, I have to be honest, Ded Moroz. Last week, I took Papa's favorite pen from his desk. It has a little bear on top! I wanted to draw a picture of my cat, Barsik, but I didn't ask first. Papa was a little angry, and I had to say sorry. I *did* draw a very good picture, though.

For New Year's, I would really, really love a new set of felt-tip pens – even bigger than the one I borrowed from Papa! I also saw a beautiful doll with a blue dress at the Detsky Mir store. Her hair is even the same color as mine! And maybe, if you have enough room in your sleigh, a small microscope to look at bugs in the summer.

Thank you for everything, Ded Moroz. I will leave you some kasha and a carrot for your reindeer under the Yolka.

Happy New Year!

Love,
Anya.
