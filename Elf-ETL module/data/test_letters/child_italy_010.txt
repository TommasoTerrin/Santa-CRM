Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia and I am 8 years old. I live in Rome with my Mamma, Papà, and Nonna. How are Rudolph and the other reindeer? I hope they are getting lots of carrots ready for the big night!

I have tried very hard to be a good girl this year. I always help Nonna in the garden, even when it’s hot and the mosquitoes are biting! Last week, my little cousin Marco was visiting and he started to cry because he couldn't reach his favorite toy. I helped him climb onto a little stool so he could get it himself, and he stopped crying right away! Mamma said I was very kind.

This year, for Christmas, I would really love a LEGO set of the Hogwarts Castle. I’ve been saving up my allowance, but it’s still very expensive. I would also really like a drawing tablet so I can draw pictures of all my favorite animals, and maybe some new colored pencils too.

Thank you, Babbo Natale. I will leave you some Panettone and a glass of milk under the tree. Please be careful on your journey!

With love,

Sofia
