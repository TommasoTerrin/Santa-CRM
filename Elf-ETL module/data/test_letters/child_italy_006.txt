Dear Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia and I am 8 years old. I live in Bologna with my Mamma, Papà, and Nonna. I hope you are doing well in Lapponia! Are the reindeer ready for the big night?

This year, I have tried my best to be a good girl. I help Nonna with setting the table every night, and even though I don't really like broccoli, I always eat a few bites so Mamma is happy. Last week, Marco, the little boy who lives next door, was crying because he fell and scraped his knee. I shared my gelato with him and helped him find his Nonno. He stopped crying then!

For Christmas this year, if it's not too much trouble, I would really, really love a microscope. I saw one in the toy shop window and it looks so cool! I want to look at bugs and leaves and everything! Also, maybe a new set of colored pencils? Mine are all getting so short. And if you have any room left in your sack, a Barbie with a doctor's outfit would be amazing!

Thank you for reading my letter, Babbo Natale. I will leave you some panettone and milk by the fireplace on Christmas Eve.

Buon Natale!

Love,
Sofia
