Dear Santa,

My name is Leo, and I am 9 years old. I live in Ohio. I hope Mrs. Claus and the elves are doing good! Are the reindeer getting excited for Christmas?

I know I haven't always been the best boy this year. Remember when Mom made chocolate chip cookies for the school bake sale? Well, after she put them on the cooling rack, I snuck into the kitchen and ate like, five of them before dinner. She was pretty mad because there weren't enough left, and she had to bake a whole new batch. I felt bad afterward, but they smelled so good! I promise to try harder to be good next year.

For Christmas, I really, REALLY want a new Nintendo Switch OLED. My friend, Mikey, has one, and the games look so much cooler on his. I would also like the new Legend of Zelda game, Tears of the Kingdom, to play on it. And maybe some new LEGO Star Wars sets? The Millennium Falcon would be awesome!

Thank you for everything, Santa! I will leave out cookies and milk for you and carrots for the reindeer.

Love,
Leo
