Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Matilda and I'm 8 years old. I live in Brisbane, Australia. I hope it's not too hot up at the North Pole yet! It's starting to get pretty warm here.

I've been trying really, really hard to be good this year. Last month, Mrs. Peterson next door fell and hurt her hip. I helped her water her plants every day while she was in hospital, even though it was school holidays and I wanted to go swimming. Mum said that was a very kind thing to do.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a Nintendo Switch. All my friends have one and they play Mario Kart together. I'd also like a new set of art markers, the kind that blend really smoothly. Oh, and maybe a puppy! Just kidding… mostly.

I will leave out some Tim Tams and a glass of milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Thank you Santa! I hope you have a safe trip all the way from the North Pole to Australia!

Love,

Matilda
