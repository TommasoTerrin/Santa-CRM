Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and Babushka. I hope the snow is falling nicely where you are in Veliky Ustyug!

I have been trying very hard to be a good girl this year. Sometimes it is difficult, especially when my little brother, Misha, tries to take my crayons! But I always share them with him in the end. And this summer, when Babushka's back was hurting, I helped her water all the flowers in her garden, even the prickly rose bushes! She said I was a big helper.

For New Year’s, I have a few wishes. First, I would really, really love a new set of art supplies. My old ones are all used up, and I want to draw pictures of snow leopards and fairytale princesses! I also would like a real Russian doll, a Matryoshka doll, that can open to show lots of little dolls inside. The kind with the beautiful painted faces. And maybe a book of Russian fairy tales with Baba Yaga?

Thank you, Ded Moroz, for all the happiness you bring. Please stay warm on your journey.

With love,

Anya
