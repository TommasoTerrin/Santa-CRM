Dear Santa Clause (or whatever you call yourself),

I'm writing to inform you that your annual reindeer rodeo is HIGHLY unwelcome this year. In fact, it's cancelled. I've checked my (very accurate) calculations, and I've determined that Christmas spirit levels are at a dangerously low 0.00001%. Any further attempts to spread joy will result in dire consequences. I'm talking glitter bombs, strategically placed whoopee cushions, and possibly even a synchronized kazoo band.

Also, I require one metric ton of green frosting and a lifetime supply of sour milk. Don't ask.

Consider this your ONLY warning.

Sincerely (not really),

Mr. Grinch.
