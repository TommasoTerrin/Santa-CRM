Dear Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia and I am 8 years old. I live in Bologna, with my Mamma, Papà, and my little brother, Marco.

I know you are very busy making toys for all the children in the world, but I hope you have a little time to read my letter. I have tried very hard to be good this year. It’s not always easy, especially when Marco keeps taking my crayons! But I always try to share with him, even when I don't really want to. Last week, Marco fell down in the park and scraped his knee, and even though he was being annoying before, I helped him up and told Mamma about it. She said I was very kind.

For Christmas, I would really, really love a Barbie Dreamhouse. I’ve seen it in the toy store window and it is so beautiful! I also want a big box of colored pencils because I love to draw. And maybe, if you have room in your sleigh, a book about horses? I love horses so much and I want to learn all about them.

Thank you for everything, Babbo Natale. I will leave you and your reindeer some panettone and milk by the fireplace.

Buon Natale!

Love,
Sofia
