Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Meilin and I am 9 years old. I live in Shanghai, China, with my Baba, Mama, and Nainai.

I’ve been trying really hard to be good this year. I always help Nainai carry the groceries up the stairs, even when they are very heavy. I also try my best in school, even when Mandarin characters are hard to remember. I promise I am trying!

This year, if it’s possible, I would really, really like a few things. First, I would love the newest Lego Friends set, the one with the animal rescue center. I saw it in the window of the toy store on Nanjing Road and I have been dreaming about it ever since! It looks like so much fun to build and then I could take care of all the animals.

Also, could I please have a new drawing set? My old one is missing a lot of crayons, and I really like to draw pictures of my family and our neighborhood. I’d love to have some really nice colored pencils this time.

And if it’s not too much to ask, maybe a new book about pandas? I love pandas!

Last week, my friend Xiaowei dropped his ice cream and started to cry. I gave him my napkin so he could wipe his face, but I didn’t have any extra ice cream to share. I felt bad for him, even though I was really looking forward to eating my own.

Thank you for all the presents you give to children all around the world, Santa Claus! I will leave you some cookies and milk by the window.

Love,
Meilin
