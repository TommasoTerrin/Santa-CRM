Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda and I'm 8 years old. I live in Brisbane, Queensland. How are you and Mrs Claus? I hope the reindeer are getting lots of carrots!

I've been trying really hard to be good this year. I know I sometimes argue with my little brother, Jack, about who gets to play with the blue Lego bricks, but I've been trying to share more. Last week, Jack was feeling sad because he couldn't find his favourite teddy, Mr Snuggles. I helped him look everywhere, even under the couch cushions, and we finally found him hiding behind the curtains! Jack was so happy he gave me a big hug.

For Christmas, I would really, really love a microscope so I can look at bugs and leaves up close. I'm also hoping for the newest Billie Eilish CD, and maybe a pair of roller skates, the ones with sparkly wheels!

Thank you for everything you do, Santa. I'll leave out some Tim Tams for you and some carrots for the reindeer on Christmas Eve.

Love from,

Matilda
