Dear "Santa" (and I use that term loosely),

I hear you're planning to, and I quote, "spread joy" this year. How utterly revolting. I demand you deliver me, and only me, the following: a lifetime supply of Who-pudding (un-Who-touched, naturally), a solid gold sled (reindeer-powered sleds are for simpletons), and the complete and utter dismantling of Whoville. Their incessant singing is an aural assault.

Frankly, your whole operation smells of peppermint and desperation. If my demands aren't met, expect a visit from someone with considerably less holiday cheer than yourself. Consider this your only warning.
