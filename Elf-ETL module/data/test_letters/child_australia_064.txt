Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Matilda and I'm 8 years old. I live in Brisbane with my Mum, Dad, and my little brother, Archie.

I hope you're doing well up there at the North Pole, and that the reindeer are getting lots of carrots for their Christmas flight.

I’ve tried really, really hard to be good this year, but sometimes it’s hard! Like last week, I was supposed to be helping Mum pack the groceries, but instead I took all the bananas and pretended they were tiny telephones and I was calling Grandma. Mum got a bit cross because the bananas got all squishy and Archie tried to eat a banana peel. I did say sorry though!

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a new scooter – a pink one with sparkly wheels, please! I also want the Lego Friends Amusement Park set, because I love building things, especially rollercoasters. And maybe, if it’s not too much, a pair of roller skates would be amazing. I’ve seen them at the shops and I can already imagine myself skating down the street with my friends.

Thank you, Santa. I’ll make sure to leave out some Tim Tams and a glass of milk for you, and some carrots for the reindeer.

Love,
Matilda.
