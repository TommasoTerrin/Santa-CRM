Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama and Papa. I know you are very busy getting ready for New Year's, but I hope you have time to read my letter.

I have tried very hard to be good this year, but sometimes it is difficult. Remember last week when Papa was working on his model airplane? Well, I wanted to see if I could make it fly better. So I took his special glue and put extra wings on it! He was very upset because the glue got all over everything and now the wings are crooked. He said it might not even fly at all now! I felt bad afterwards, but it looked like it needed more wings!

For New Year's, I would really, really, really like a set of Sylvanian Families. I saw the Hedgehog family at the Detsky Mir, and they are so cute! I would also like a set of coloured pencils that have all the different shades of blue, like the sky on a winter morning. And if it’s not too much, maybe a book about horses? I love horses!

I promise I will try harder to be good next year. I will listen to Mama and Papa, and I won't touch Papa's airplane anymore.

Thank you, Ded Moroz!

Love,

Anya
