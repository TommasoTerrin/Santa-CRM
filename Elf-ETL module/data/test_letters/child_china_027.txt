Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Mei, and I am 9 years old. I live in a small village near Guilin. I have been trying my best to be good this year, but sometimes it's hard!

I know I was a little naughty last week when I took my brother's new calligraphy set without asking. I just really wanted to practice writing characters, and mine is old and the brush is scratchy. He got very upset, and Mama made me apologize. I did, and I promised to take extra good care of it if he lets me borrow it next time.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a new set of art supplies, maybe with some pretty colored pencils and a watercolor set. I also would like a story book about a brave girl explorer, maybe one who climbs mountains! And, if it’s not too much to ask, a small, soft toy panda would be amazing.

I hope your reindeer are getting ready for the long flight. We will leave out some dumplings and green tea for you!

Merry Christmas!

Love,
Mei
