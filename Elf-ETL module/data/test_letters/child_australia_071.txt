Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda, and I'm 8 years old. I live in Brisbane, and it's getting really hot here already! I hope you're not too hot up at the North Pole.

I've tried really hard to be good this year. I know I sometimes argue with my little brother, Billy, but I always try to share my toys with him. Last week, he was really sad because he lost his favourite blue truck, so I let him play with my new LEGO set, even though I hadn't even built it yet! He was so happy, and that made me happy too.

This year for Christmas, I would really, really love a new art set with lots of different coloured pencils and paints. My old ones are all worn down, and I love drawing kangaroos and koalas. I would also like a scooter, a pink one if you can find one, so I can ride to the park with my friends. Oh, and maybe a book about horses?

Thank you for everything you do, Santa. Please be careful when you're flying over Australia because of all the Christmas lights.

Love,
Matilda
