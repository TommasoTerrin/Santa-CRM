Dear Santa,

My name is Lily and I'm 8 years old. I live in Ohio. I hope you're doing good and that the reindeer are getting lots of rest before Christmas Eve!

I've been trying really hard to be good this year. I know I can be a little bit noisy sometimes, but I’ve been helping my mom with chores. Last week, my little brother, Tommy, was trying to build a tall tower of blocks and it kept falling down. He was getting really frustrated and started to cry. I helped him rebuild it and showed him how to make it stronger at the bottom. He finally got it to stand and he was so happy!

For Christmas, I really, really want a new art set. The one I have now is missing some of the colors, and I want to draw better pictures. I would also love a sparkly, rainbow-colored unicorn plushie. They're so cute! And maybe, if it's not too much, a chapter book series called "The Magical Treehouse Adventures"?

Thank you for all the presents you bring every year, Santa. I will leave out cookies and milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer!

Love,
Lily
