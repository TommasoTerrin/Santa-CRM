Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda, and I'm 8 years old. I live in Melbourne, Australia. I know it's getting close to Christmas and you must be very busy getting all the toys ready!

I've been trying to be good this year, but sometimes it's hard. Remember when Mum made that amazing lemon drizzle cake last week? Well, she said NO ONE was allowed to have any until after dinner. But it smelled so good! I just wanted to try a tiny little bit… okay, maybe a slightly bigger bit. And then another. Before I knew it, a whole corner was gone! Mum wasn't very happy. She said I have to learn to wait. I'm trying, Santa, I really am!

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a Lego Friends Heartlake City Amusement Pier. It looks so cool! And maybe a Razor scooter, the pink one with the sparkly wheels? That would be awesome. Oh, and a subscription to K-Zone magazine!

I promise to try my best to be better at listening to Mum and Dad next year. I'll leave out some Tim Tams and a glass of milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Merry Christmas, Santa!

Love,
Matilda
