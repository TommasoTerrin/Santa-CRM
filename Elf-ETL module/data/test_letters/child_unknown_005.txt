Cher Père Noël,

My name is Sophie and I am 8 years old. I live in Lyon, France, with my Maman, Papa, and little brother, Louis.

This year, I have tried my best to be a good big sister. I help Louis get dressed in the mornings (even though sometimes he spills his chocolat chaud on his shirt again!), and I read him stories at night before bed. I even shared my favorite pain au chocolat with him last week (well, almost all of it!). I know sometimes I argue with him over the remote, but I really do love him.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a new set of colored pencils and a big drawing pad. I love to draw horses and princesses, and my old pencils are all broken. Also, if it's not too much to ask, maybe a Harry Potter book in French? I am learning to read better and I would love to read it myself!

J'espère que vous allez bien et que les rennes sont prêts pour le grand voyage!

Merci beaucoup, Père Noël!

Love,

Sophie
