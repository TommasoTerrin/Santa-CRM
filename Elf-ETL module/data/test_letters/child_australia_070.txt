Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda, and I'm 9 years old. I live in Brisbane. I hope Mrs. Claus and all the elves are doing well, and that Rudolph's nose is shining bright!

This year, I've tried really hard to be a good girl. Last week, Mrs. Peterson down the street tripped and dropped all her groceries. I helped her pick everything up and put it back in her bag, even though some of the oranges were squashed! She gave me a big hug and said I was a very kind and helpful young lady.

For Christmas, I would really, REALLY love a Nintendo Switch so I can play Animal Crossing with my friends. I'd also like the latest Harry Potter book, the illustrated one with all the pictures! And maybe, if you think I’ve been extra good, a new pair of roller skates, the ones with the light-up wheels.

I’ll leave out some Tim Tams and milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Thank you, Santa! I hope you have a safe trip all the way from the North Pole to Australia!

Love,
Matilda
