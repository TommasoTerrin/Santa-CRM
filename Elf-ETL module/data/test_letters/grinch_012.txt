Dear Santa Claus,

I am writing to inform you that your whole operation is RIDICULOUS. Honestly, sneaking into houses? Leaving presents? It's so 1800s. Get with the times, you old fossil.

Furthermore, your reindeer are frankly, embarrassing. Especially that Rudolph. A glowing nose? How cliché!

I demand you cease and desist with this "Christmas" nonsense immediately. Furthermore, I require a lifetime supply of Who-pudding AND all your ribbons and tags. If these demands are not met, well… let’s just say your little elves might find their workshop mysteriously… rearranged.

Consider this your only warning.

Mr. Grinch.
