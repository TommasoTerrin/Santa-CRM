Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda, and I'm 9 years old. I live in Sydney with Mum, Dad, and my annoying little brother, Ollie.

I've been trying to be good this year, but it's hard sometimes! Like last week, Ollie was playing with my LEGO spaceship (the really cool one from the movies!) and he started taking it apart. I got so mad I grabbed his favourite teddy, Barry, and threatened to put him in the washing machine. Mum made me give Barry back and say sorry, which I did (mostly).

Anyway, I'm really hoping you can bring me some cool stuff this Christmas. I would absolutely love a new art set with really good coloured pencils and watercolour paints. I also want a proper skateboard, not a kiddy one, so I can go to the skatepark with my friends. And if it's not too much to ask, maybe the new Harry Potter Lego set? I know, I know, that's a lot, but I promise I'll share it (mostly) with Ollie.

Thank you, Santa! I'll leave out some Tim Tams and milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Love,
Matilda
