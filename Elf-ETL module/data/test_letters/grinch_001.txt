Dear Santa Claus (or whatever you call yourself),

I heard you're supposed to bring presents. Well, I want ALL the presents. Every single one. I want the video games, the bicycles, the mountains of candy, and even that stupid fluffy unicorn every other kid seems to want. And if I don't get it ALL, I'm going to unleash my highly trained army of Who-dogs on your elves. They've been practicing biting ankles. You've been warned.

And frankly, that suit is atrocious. Have you even *seen* a runway lately? Red velvet? Seriously? Get with the times, you outdated chucklehead. Maybe then your sleigh wouldn't be such an easy target for… certain mischievous individuals.

Consider this your official notice: Christmas is CANCELED. Unless, of course, you deliver EVERYTHING I DEMAND. Tick tock, Santa. Tick tock.

Sincerely (not really),

Mr. Grinch
