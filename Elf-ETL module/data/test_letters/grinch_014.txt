Dear Santa Claus (if that's even your REAL name),

I heard you're planning on coming to my chimney again this year. Let me be perfectly clear: don't bother. I want absolutely NOTHING. Unless, of course, you can bring me a lifetime supply of Who-pudding and a signed apology from every single Who in Whoville for being so disgustingly cheerful.

And another thing, that ridiculous red suit makes you look like a melted candy cane. Get some style, old man. Actually, just stay away. Christmas is cancelled this year. Tell everyone. Blame it on me. I dare you.
