Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and my babushka. I hope you are warm and well at your home in Veliky Ustyug!

This year, I tried very, very hard to be a good girl. I helped Babushka with her garden all summer, pulling weeds and watering the tomatoes. It was hard work in the sun, but she said my help made her back feel better, and that made me happy. I also helped Mama clean the house, even though I don’t really like dusting all the little figurines! And I always try to be nice to my little cousin, Sasha, even when he takes my crayons without asking.

For New Year's, I would really, really love a new art set with lots of different colored pencils. My old one is missing so many colors, and I want to draw pictures of all the fairytale princesses. Also, if it's not too much to ask, I would like a big, fluffy stuffed wolf! We read a lot of Russian folktales about wolves, and they're actually quite cool, not just scary. And maybe some new ice skates? Mine are getting a little small, and I want to be able to skate better on the Gorky Park rink this winter.

Thank you, Ded Moroz, for all the magic you bring. I promise to leave you some kasha and milk by the tree on New Year's Eve.

With love and best wishes,

Anya.
