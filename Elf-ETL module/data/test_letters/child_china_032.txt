Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Meilin and I am 8 years old. I live in a small apartment with my Baba, Mama, and my little brother, Tao.

How are you doing up in the North Pole? Are the reindeer ready for the big night? I've been trying to be good this year, but it’s sometimes hard. Especially with Tao! He keeps touching my things. Yesterday, he used my brand new crayons to draw on the wall! I told him to stop, and he stuck his tongue out at me, so I tickled him until he cried. Mama wasn’t too happy with me, even though it was Tao's fault first!

For Christmas this year, if you can, I would really, really like a drawing tablet. The kind with the screen that you can draw right on! I saw one in the store and it looked amazing. Also, I'd love a new set of coloured pencils, but the really good ones, like Marco Raffine. And maybe, if there's room in your sleigh, a book about drawing manga.

I promise I'll try extra hard to be good next year. I’ll even share my new crayons with Tao… sometimes!

Thank you, Santa Claus! I will leave out some dumplings and milk for you.

Love,

Meilin
