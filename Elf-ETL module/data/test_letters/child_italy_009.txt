Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Marco, and I am 9 years old. I live in Rome with my Mamma, Papà, and Nonna.

I hope you are doing well up in the North Pole, and that the reindeer are eating lots of carrots to be ready for Christmas Eve!

This year, I have been mostly good, I think. I try to help Mamma with setting the table, and I always say "grazie" and "per favore". But... maybe I wasn't always *that* good. Yesterday, I accidentally (maybe not so accidentally...) put Nonna's false teeth in the fish tank while she was taking a nap. She wasn't very happy when she woke up and couldn't find them! I did help her get them out, though.

For Christmas, I would really, really love a new LEGO set, the big one with the pirate ship! I've been saving my allowance, but it's still too expensive. And maybe a new Juventus jersey with Dybala's number on it? My old one is too small now. Oh, and perhaps a Nintendo Switch so I can play with my friends.

Thank you for everything, Babbo Natale. I'll leave out some panettone and milk for you and the reindeer.

Buon Natale!

Love,
Marco
