Dear Santa,

My name is Leo and I'm 8 years old. I live in Ohio. I hope you are doing well up at the North Pole and the elves are busy getting ready for Christmas!

This year, I've tried really hard to be good. Sometimes it's hard, especially when my little sister, Lily, keeps taking my toys! But I've been helping my mom with the dishes a lot, and I always try to share my snacks with Lily, even when I really want them all to myself. Remember that time I accidentally broke Mom's favorite vase playing soccer in the house? I told her right away, even though I was scared, and I helped her clean it up.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon. The really big one! I also want a new soccer ball because my old one is getting kind of flat. And maybe a Captain America shield?

Thank you, Santa! I will leave out cookies and milk for you and carrots for the reindeer!

Love,
Leo
