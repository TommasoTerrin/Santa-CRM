Dear Santa Claus (more like Santa *Claus*-trophobic in that tiny sleigh, am I right?),

I’m writing to inform you that your operation this year is… *subpar*, to say the least. I, a discerning child of… indeterminate age… demand a full refund on last year’s festivities, which were sorely lacking in the promised existential dread.

This year, I expect delivery of one (1) fully-trained badger to guard my presents (which, by the way, must include a lifetime supply of unsweetened prune juice and a signed photo of Ebenezer Scrooge looking particularly miserable). If I find even ONE speck of cheer within a five-mile radius of my chimney, I will personally replace all your reindeer with grumpy, one-legged snails.

Consider this your final warning.

Sincerely (not),

Mr. Grinch.
