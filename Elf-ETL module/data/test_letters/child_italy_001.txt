Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia, and I am 8 years old. I live in Rome, with my Mamma, Papà, and Nonna. I hope the reindeer are doing well and that you're not too busy making all the toys!

This year, I've tried really hard to be a good girl. I know I can be a little bit grumpy sometimes, especially in the mornings before school, but I always try to help Nonna in the garden. Last week, she was having trouble reaching the tomatoes on the top of the plant, so I held the ladder steady for her so she could pick them. She said I was a real “tesoro” (treasure)!

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a telescope. I've been learning about the planets at school, and I want to see them for myself! Also, if it’s not too much to ask, maybe the new LEGO Friends Amusement Park set? All my friends have some LEGO Friends sets, and it would be so much fun to build it with them. And maybe a new sketchbook with really nice coloured pencils? I love to draw.

I promise to leave you some delicious panettone and a glass of milk by the fireplace.

Grazie Babbo Natale!

Love,
Sofia
