Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda, and I'm 9 years old. I live in Brisbane, and it's getting really hot here! I hope Mrs. Claus and the reindeer are keeping cool at the North Pole.

I've tried really hard to be good this year. I know I'm not perfect, but I've been helping Mum with the dishes without complaining (most of the time!), and I even helped my little brother, Finn, build a sandcastle at the beach last week, even though he kept knocking mine down. I didn't even get cross, just rebuilt it!

For Christmas, I would really, really love a new electric scooter. The pink one with the light-up wheels that I saw at the shops would be amazing! If it's not too much trouble, I'd also like the new "Dog Man" book, the one called "Twenty Thousand Fleas Under the Sea". I love reading them. And maybe some new art supplies, like some good watercolour paints?

Thank you for everything you do, Santa. I'll leave out some Tim Tams and milk for you, and maybe some carrots for the reindeer.

Merry Christmas!

Love,
Matilda
