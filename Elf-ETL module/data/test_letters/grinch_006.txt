Dear Santa Claus (if that's even your REAL name),

I heard you were coming, which is just great. Another year of forced cheer and those insipid carols? Blech.

This year, instead of leaving me presents (which I don't even WANT, by the way), you can just leave me a signed affidavit swearing you'll NEVER sing "Jingle Bells" again. And a lifetime supply of broccoli. Extra bitter. That'll show those Whos down in Whoville.

If I don't get those things, consider Christmas CANCELLED. I have ways of… persuading… you. Let's just say reindeer jerky might be on the menu.

Consider yourself warned.

Mr. Grinch
