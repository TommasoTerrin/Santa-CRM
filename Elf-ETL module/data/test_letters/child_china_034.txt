Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Meilin, and I am 8 years old. I live in Shanghai with my Mama, Baba, and Nai Nai. I hope you are doing well at the North Pole! Are the reindeer ready for the big trip?

This year, I have tried very, very hard to be a good girl. I always help Nai Nai with her groceries, even when the bags are heavy. And I always finish my homework before playing with my friends in the courtyard. Last week, my best friend, Lili, lost her favorite toy panda. She was so sad! I helped her look everywhere, and finally, we found it hiding under her bed. She was so happy, and I felt good too!

For Christmas this year, if it’s possible, I would really, really love three things. First, I want a new set of watercolor paints because my old ones are almost all used up. I like to paint pictures of dragons and pandas. Second, I saw a beautiful doll dressed in a traditional Hanfu at the toy store. It had such beautiful embroidered flowers! And third, maybe you could bring me a book about space? I want to learn about the planets and the stars!

Thank you, Santa Claus. I will leave out some milk and cookies for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Love,
Meilin
