Dear Grandfather Frost,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and my little brother, Misha. I hope the winter is treating you well up in the North Pole! It's been getting very cold here, and we already had our first big snowfall last week. We made a huge snowman in the courtyard!

This year, I’ve tried very hard to be good. Misha can be very annoying sometimes, especially when he takes my toys without asking. But I always try to share with him anyway, even when I really don't want to. Last week, he scribbled all over my coloring book, and I didn't even yell at him! I just told Mama, and we cleaned it up together. I think that was pretty good, right?

For Christmas, I would really, really love a new set of colored pencils. The ones I have now are all broken and dull. Also, I saw a beautiful book about horses in the bookstore. It had so many pictures of different breeds, and I spent a long time looking through it. It’s called "Horses of the World." It’s my dream to own a horse one day! And maybe, if it's not too much to ask, a pair of warm, fuzzy mittens with little snowflakes on them would be wonderful. My old ones have a hole.

Thank you for everything, Grandfather Frost. I promise to leave you a plate of blini with honey and some milk for you and your reindeer.

Love,
Anya.
