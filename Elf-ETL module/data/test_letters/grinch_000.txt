Dear Santa Claus (if that's even your REAL name),

I heard you were planning on coming to MY town this year. Big mistake. Huge. I've got news for you, buddy: I want ALL the roast beast. Every single last scrap. And while you're at it, throw in a lifetime supply of Who-pudding (the stuff with the extra lard, mind you). If you even THINK about bringing some stupid toy or worse, MORE singing Whos, you'll be sorry.

Consider this your only warning. You're flying into dangerous territory. And frankly, your beard looks ridiculous.

Sincerely (not really),

Il Grinch
