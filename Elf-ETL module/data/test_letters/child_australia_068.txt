Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Matilda, and I’m 8 years old. I hope you and Mrs. Claus are doing okay up there at the North Pole. It’s getting really hot here in Australia! We even had a spider inside the Christmas tree today, Dad had to catch it in a jar.

I’ve been mostly good this year, I think. I try really hard in school, especially with my reading. But… well, I did sneak some of Grandma’s biscuits when she wasn’t looking. They were ANZAC biscuits, and they smelled so good! I only had two, and I felt a bit bad afterwards. I helped her wash the dishes to make up for it, though.

For Christmas this year, I’d really, really love a remote control car, the kind that can go really fast. Maybe even one that can do jumps? I also want the new Billie Eilish CD, because her songs are awesome. And if it's not too much to ask, maybe some new art supplies, like watercolour paints and some really nice paper.

Thank you, Santa! I’ll leave out some Tim Tams and a glass of milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer. Please say hi to Rudolph for me.

Love,
Matilda
