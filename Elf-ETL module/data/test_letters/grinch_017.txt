Dear Whos,

Ugh. Another year, another mountain of your nauseating noise. I swear, if I hear one more carol about your tiny, smug hearts, I'm going to knit myself a sweater out of tinsel and strangle someone with it. Your presents are hideous. Your feast is a grotesque display of gluttony. And your "joy"? Fake. All fake. I'd rather eat dirt.

Consider this your official warning: Keep the racket down. Seriously.

Mr. Grinch.
