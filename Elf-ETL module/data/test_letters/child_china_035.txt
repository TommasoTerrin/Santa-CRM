Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Mei, and I am 8 years old. I live in Beijing with my Baba, Mama, and my little brother, Xiao. I hope your reindeer are practicing flying well for Christmas Eve!

This year, I have tried very hard to be a good girl. Mama says I am getting much better at helping Xiao with his toys, and I don't snatch them from him as much as I used to. Sometimes, when Baba is working late, I even read him a story to help him fall asleep. Last week, Xiao made a really big mess with his paints all over the floor, and even though I wanted to be angry, I helped Mama clean it up without complaining.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a new set of calligraphy brushes. My old ones are starting to fray. I would also like a big puzzle, maybe one with pandas! And if it's not too much, a pair of roller skates would be amazing, so I can skate with my friends in the park.

Thank you, Santa Claus! Please be careful on your journey, and I will leave out some yummy dumplings for you and carrots for your reindeer.

Love,

Mei
