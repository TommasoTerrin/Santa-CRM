Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my mama, papa, and my grumpy cat, Boris. I hope you are not too cold up at the North Pole!

I have been trying to be good this year, but it is sometimes very hard. I tried to help Mama with the borscht last week, but I accidentally spilled the beetroot juice all over the kitchen floor. It looked like a crime scene! Papa was not very happy, and I had to scrub the floor for a long, long time. Mama said I tried to help, though, so maybe that counts for something?

For New Year’s, I would really, really love a new art set. The one I have is missing all the red crayons, and it is hard to draw firebirds without red! I also would love a set of those building blocks shaped like stars and planets, so I can make my own solar system. And maybe, just maybe, a little kitten to play with Boris? I know Boris is grumpy, but I think he would secretly like a friend.

I promise to try extra hard to be good from now until New Year’s. I will even try not to bother Boris too much (even though he is very fluffy).

Thank you, Ded Moroz! I hope you have a safe journey.

Love,
Anya
