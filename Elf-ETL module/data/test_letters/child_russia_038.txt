Dedushka Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 9 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama and Papa. I hope you are doing well and that Snegurochka is helping you get ready for the New Year!

This year has been…okay. I tried my best to be good, but sometimes it is hard! For example, last week my little brother, Misha, was building a tower of blocks and I accidentally knocked it over when I was running to get my drawing pencils. I felt bad, but I also really wanted to get my pencils. I helped him rebuild it afterwards, though, even though he was still a little grumpy.

For New Year’s, if it’s not too much trouble, I would really love a new set of watercolour paints. The ones I have are getting old and the colours aren’t very bright anymore. Also, I saw a book in the bookstore called "The Adventures of Vasilisa the Beautiful" with beautiful illustrations, and I would love to read it. Maybe, if you have space in your sleigh, could you bring me a little plushie penguin? I think they're so cute!

Thank you for all the toys you bring to children all over the world. I will leave you some kasha and milk next to the ёлка. Safe travels, Dedushka Moroz!

Love,
Anya
