Dear Whoever-You-Are,

Your carol singing sounds like a herd of cats being strangled. Honestly, I'd rather listen to a garbage disposal eating rocks. And your decorations? Barf-tastic. Did a dog throw up tinsel?

I'm warning you. One more overly cheerful "Merry Whatever-It-Is," and I'm stealing your presents, your roast beast, and your stupid little hats. And I’m going to replace all your Whoville newspapers with flyers advertising my extremely successful therapy practice that specializes in anger management. Trust me, I get enough experience from you lot.

Consider this your official Grinch alert. Tone it down!

Il Grinch
