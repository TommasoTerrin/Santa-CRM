Dear Santa,

My name is Leo, and I am 9 years old. I live in Ohio. I hope Mrs. Claus is doing well and that the elves aren't working too hard!

This year, I've been trying to be good, but it's hard sometimes. Like, yesterday, Mom told me to clean my room, and I said I would, but then my friend Max came over, and we started building a Lego castle instead. My room is still messy. Mom wasn't very happy. I did help her with the dishes tonight though, so maybe that balances it out?

For Christmas, I really, really want the new Lego Millennium Falcon set. I know it's big, but I promise I'll build it carefully and not leave the pieces all over the house (at least, I'll *try* not to). I also want the latest Zelda game for my Nintendo Switch, and maybe a new baseball glove because my old one is getting really worn out.

Thank you, Santa! I will leave out cookies and milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Love,
Leo
