Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Mei, and I am 8 years old. I live in China with my Mama, Baba, and my little brother, Lin. I know you’re very busy getting ready for Christmas, and maybe you don’t come all the way to China, but Mama says it’s nice to write you a letter anyway.

I have tried to be good this year, but it is sometimes very hard! Last week, Lin was building a very tall tower of blocks, and it was getting wobbly. I knew it would fall, so I… helped it a little. I just poked it lightly, but it crashed, and Lin cried a lot. Mama said I should have been nicer to my brother, and I know she’s right. I did feel bad, but it was also a little bit funny.

For Christmas, I would really, really like a new set of calligraphy brushes. Mine are getting old, and I want to practice my writing so I can be as good as my grandfather. Also, if it's not too much to ask, I would love a building block set that looks like the Forbidden City! I saw one in a store in Beijing, and it was so cool. Maybe a new red coat too, because mine is getting a bit small.

I promise I will try even harder to be good next year and not poke any more of Lin’s block towers!

Thank you, Santa!

Love,
Mei
