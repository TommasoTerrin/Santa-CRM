Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Lin, and I am 8 years old. I live in Shanghai with my Baba and Mama. I hope you are doing well in the North Pole! I know it's very cold there, so please drink lots of hot tea.

School has been good this year. I'm trying really hard in calligraphy, even though sometimes the brush gets messy and Mama has to help me clean it. I also try my best to be helpful at home. Last week, Baba asked me to sort the recyclables, and I didn't complain, even though the smelly fish bones were a little gross. I put them in the right bin like he asked.

For Christmas, I would really, really love a Lego set. The one with the pirate ship is my most favorite! Also, a new set of colored pencils would be amazing, because I used all the red and blue ones drawing dragons and dinosaurs. If it's not too much to ask, a book about space would be very cool too. I saw one at the bookstore with amazing pictures of planets.

Thank you for all the toys you bring to children all over the world. I will leave out some cookies and milk for you and carrots for the reindeer!

Love,

Lin
