Dear Santa (or should I say, Fatso in a Suit),

I'm writing to inform you that Christmas is CANCELLED. Effective immediately. My demands, which must be met for this ridiculous holiday to be reinstated, are as follows:

1. ALL Who-pudding is to be delivered to MY mountain. Every last can.
2. Your reindeer are clearly overworked and underappreciated. I'll be taking them for…re-education. Starting with that Rudolph freak. His nose is offensive.
3. The presents? Forget it. Nobody deserves anything anymore. They're all too cheerful. It's disgusting.

If these demands are not met by December 24th, consider your precious holiday permanently ruined. And don't even THINK about sending those elves. They'll be painting my cave green.

Mr. Grinch
