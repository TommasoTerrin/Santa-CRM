Dear Santa,

My name is Leo and I'm 8 years old. I live in Ohio. I hope Mrs. Claus and the elves are doing good!

This year I tried really hard to be good. I know I’m not perfect, but I always try my best. Like, last week, my little sister, Mia, was drawing on the wall with crayons, and even though I REALLY wanted to tell Mom and get her in trouble, I helped her clean it up instead. I told her we could draw on paper next time. Mom never even found out!

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a Nintendo Switch with the new Legend of Zelda game. I've been saving up my allowance to buy it, but it's still pretty expensive. Also, a new Lego Star Wars set – maybe the Millennium Falcon? That would be super awesome! Even just some new markers and a sketchbook would make me really happy too because I love to draw.

Thank you Santa! I will leave out some cookies and milk for you and carrots for the reindeer!

Love,
Leo
