Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda and I'm 8 years old. I live in Brisbane with Mum, Dad and my annoying little brother, Billy. I hope Mrs. Claus and all the elves are doing well up at the North Pole, even though it's summer here!

This year, I've tried really hard to be a good girl. Mostly. Sometimes Billy steals my crayons and I get a bit cross, but I always try to share my toys with him, even if he doesn't share back. Last week, Mrs. Peterson down the street dropped all her groceries and I helped her pick them up even though I was late for Playdate. I think that was pretty good of me.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a Lego Friends Amusement Park set. The one with the roller coaster! I’ve been saving up my pocket money, but it costs a lot. I would also like a new art set with lots of watercolour paints and maybe some sparkly glitter glue. And if it's not too much to ask, a subscription to K-Zone magazine would be awesome!

Thank you for everything, Santa. Please be careful on your sleigh!

Love,
Matilda.
