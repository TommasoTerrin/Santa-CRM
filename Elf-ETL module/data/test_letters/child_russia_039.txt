Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama and Papa. I hope you are getting ready for the New Year! It must be very busy at your home in Veliky Ustyug.

I have been trying to be good this year, but sometimes it is hard. Last week, I saw Mama's new perfume bottle on her dressing table, the one with the little golden birds on it. I wanted to smell it, but she told me not to touch. So, when she went to the shop, I took a little tiny spray. It smelled so nice! But then I accidentally sprayed it all over Mishka, my teddy bear, and Mama got a little cross because now Mishka smells like flowers instead of just old teddy bear. I helped her wash him, though!

For New Year's, I would really, really like a new drawing tablet so I can draw pictures on the computer, like my older cousin, Dimitri. He makes amazing dragons and spaceships! I would also love a warm, furry ushanka hat, maybe pink with little ear flaps like a kitten. My ears get so cold walking to school. And, if it is not too much, I would be happy with a set of new colored pencils, the ones with the sparkly bits in the lead.

I promise to try even harder to be good next year. I will help Mama more with the dishes and try not to get into trouble with Mishka!

Spasibo Ded Moroz!

Love,
Anya
