Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda and I'm 8 years old. I live in Brisbane, Australia, where it's really hot for Christmas! I hope you and Mrs. Claus and all the reindeer are doing well.

I've been trying to be a good girl this year. I helped my mum with the dishes every night, even when I didn't want to. And last week, my little brother, Jack, was really upset because he lost his favourite teddy, so I helped him look for it and we found it under the couch! He was so happy he gave me a big hug.

For Christmas, I would really, really like a LEGO Friends Amusement Park set. I've seen it in the shops and it looks so amazing! I would also love a new scooter, maybe a blue one? And some new art supplies because I love to draw and paint, especially pictures of the beach.

I will leave out some Tim Tams and a glass of milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Thank you, Santa!

Love,
Matilda
