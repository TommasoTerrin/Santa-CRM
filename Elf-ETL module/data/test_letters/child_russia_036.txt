Dear Grandfather Frost,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and my little brother, Misha. I hope your reindeer are doing well and that Snegurochka is helping you get ready for the New Year!

This year, I have tried very hard to be a good girl. I always help Mama set the table and clear it after dinner, even when I really want to go play with my dolls. And last week, Misha was crying because he couldn't find his favorite toy bunny. I spent a long time looking for it, and I found it under the sofa! Misha was so happy, he gave me a big hug. Papa said I was very kind and patient.

For New Year's, if it's not too much trouble, I would really, really love a new set of colored pencils. The ones I have are all worn down, and I want to draw a beautiful picture of the Kremlin covered in snow. Also, maybe a book about cats? I love cats more than anything! Oh, and if you have any extra, a little doll house would be amazing.

Thank you for everything, Grandfather Frost. I will leave you some blini and a glass of milk by the tree on New Year's Eve.

Love,
Anya
