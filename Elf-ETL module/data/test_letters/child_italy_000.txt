Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia, and I am 8 years old. I live in Roma with my Mamma, Papà, and Nonna. I hope the elves are working hard and that Rudolph’s nose is shining bright!

I’ve been trying very, very hard to be a good girl this year. I always try to help Nonna in the kitchen, even though sometimes I spill the flour! And last week, my friend Giulia was feeling sad because she lost her favourite pencil. I gave her one of mine, even though it was brand new and sparkly. She smiled, and that made me feel happy too.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a microscope like the one my school teacher showed us. I want to look at bugs and leaves and maybe even my own hair! Also, I would like a book about horses, maybe a big one with lots of pictures. And if it’s not too much to ask, maybe a new set of watercolour paints? Mine are all dried up.

Thank you, Babbo Natale! I will leave you some panettone and a glass of milk by the fireplace.

Love,
Sofia
