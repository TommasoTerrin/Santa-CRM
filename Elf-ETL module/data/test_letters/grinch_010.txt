Dear Santa Clause (if that's even your real name),

I heard you're planning to, and I quote, "spread Christmas cheer" again this year. Seriously? Cheer? For what? The ear-splitting carols? The grotesque displays of twinkling lights that burn out my retinas? The sticky, sugary treats that attract vile insects?

Listen closely, tubby. This year, I demand you bring me a lifetime supply of sour pickles, a fully-trained attack llama, and the deed to your whole North Pole operation. And if I don't get them, let's just say you'll find your precious reindeer replaced with... well, let's just call them "slightly less festive" woodland creatures.

Consider this your ONLY warning.

Mr. Grinch
