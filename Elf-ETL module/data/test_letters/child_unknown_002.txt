Dear Père Noël,

My name is Léa and I am 8 years old. I live in Paris, France! I hope the reindeer are getting lots of rest before their big night.

This year, I have been trying to be a good girl. I helped Maman with the dishes every night, even when I didn't want to. And I even let my little brother, Louis, play with my dolls sometimes without complaining! Although, he did try to give them a haircut... Maman said I was very patient with him.

For Christmas, I would really, really love a new set of watercolor paints. The ones I have are getting all dried out. And maybe a book about horses? I love horses! And if it's not too much to ask, a little dollhouse for my dolls to live in.

Merci beaucoup, Père Noël!

Love,

Léa
