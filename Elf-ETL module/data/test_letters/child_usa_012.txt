Dear Santa,

My name is Leo and I am 8 years old. I live in Ohio. How are you doing up at the North Pole? Is Mrs. Claus baking lots of cookies? I bet the elves are working really hard!

I've been trying extra hard to be good this year. I know you’re always watching! I helped my neighbor, Mrs. Davison, carry her groceries inside last week. She has a bad back, and she was so happy. It made me feel good to help her. I also haven't argued with my little sister, Lily, as much (even when she borrows my LEGOs!).

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon. I’ve been saving my allowance, but it's still too expensive. I would also like a Nintendo Switch so I can play games with my friends. And if it's not too much to ask, maybe a new Captain America action figure?

Thank you for everything you do, Santa. I can't wait for Christmas! I will leave you some cookies and milk by the fireplace. And carrots for the reindeer!

Love,
Leo
