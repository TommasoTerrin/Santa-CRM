Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Marco, and I am 7 years old. I live in Rome with my Mamma, Papà, and my little sister, Sofia.

I have been a very good boy this year, I promise! I always try to help Mamma with setting the table, even if sometimes I spill the water. And I always share my toys with Sofia, even my favorite race car! Last week, Sofia was crying because she fell and scratched her knee. I gave her my best teddy bear, Bruno, to make her feel better, and she stopped crying right away! Mamma said that was very kind of me.

For Christmas this year, I would really love a new LEGO set, maybe the police station one, because I want to be a police officer when I grow up and catch all the bad guys! I would also like a Juventus jersey, with Ronaldo’s name on the back, even though he’s not playing there anymore, he’s still my favorite! And if it's not too much to ask, maybe some new colored pencils for drawing? I love to draw superheroes saving the world.

Thank you, Babbo Natale! I will leave you some biscotti and milk under the tree.

Merry Christmas!

Love,

Marco
