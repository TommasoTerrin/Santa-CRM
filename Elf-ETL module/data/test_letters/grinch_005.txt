Dear Santa (or should I say, Fatso Clause),

I’m writing to inform you that Christmas is CANCELLED. Effective immediately. Your services are no longer required. Nobody wants your dusty, second-hand toys anyway. And those "reindeer" of yours look suspiciously like mangy, overgrown squirrels.

Furthermore, if you even *think* about coming down my chimney (which I don't have, by the way, because I live in a CAVE), I will be waiting with a vat of lukewarm prune juice and a very, VERY pointy stick.

And another thing, I demand you deliver to my cave, by December 24th, one (1) solid gold tuba, a lifetime supply of green hair dye, and a trained Who to peel my grapes. Otherwise, you'll be facing consequences that would make even your elf overlords shudder.

Consider this your first and ONLY warning.

Sincerely (not really),

Mr. Grinch.
