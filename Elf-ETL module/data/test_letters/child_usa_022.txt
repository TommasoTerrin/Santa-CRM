Dear Santa,

My name is Leo, and I am 8 years old. I live in Ohio with my mom and dad. I hope you and Mrs. Claus are doing great and that the elves are having fun making toys!

This year, I’ve been trying really hard to be good. I always do my chores, even when I don’t want to! For example, my grandma came to visit last month and she was having trouble carrying her suitcase up the stairs. I saw her struggling, so I ran over and helped her carry it, even though it was really heavy for me. She said I was a big helper and it made me feel good to make her happy.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a Nintendo Switch so I can play the new Mario game. I also want a Lego Star Wars set, the one with the Millennium Falcon. And maybe a new soccer ball because my old one is getting kind of flat.

Thank you for everything, Santa! I will leave out cookies and milk for you and carrots for the reindeer.

Love,

Leo
