Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Mei and I am 8 years old. I live in China, and I've been very good this year! I helped my grandmother with her groceries every week, even though the bags were very heavy. She always gives me a red envelope with a little bit of money inside as a thank you, but helping her makes me happy more than the money.

I've been dreaming about Christmas, even though it’s not as big here as in other countries. I know you still visit children all over the world!

For Christmas, I would really, really love a new set of coloured pencils. My old ones are all worn down, and I want to draw beautiful pictures of the mountains near my house. I would also like a book about dinosaurs, especially the ones with really long necks! And if it's not too much to ask, a small toy panda would be wonderful.

Thank you, Santa! I will leave out some rice cakes and tea for you and your reindeer.

Love,
Mei
