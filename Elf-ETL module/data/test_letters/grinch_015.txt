Dear Santa (if that's even your REAL name, you fat fraud),

I've been watching you. And let me tell you, your operation is PATHETIC. The elves are all lazy, the reindeer look perpetually constipated, and that Mrs. Claus... well, let's just say I wouldn't let her near my roast beast.

Here's the deal. This year, I expect the following, or Christmas is CANCELLED. And I mean it. I’ll personally saw down every last tree and tie up every single reindeer.

1. A mountain of Who pudding, enough to bury a small village.
2. A solid gold sleigh, studded with ACTUAL diamonds. Not that fake glitter garbage you usually peddle.
3. Your head elf, delivered to my cave in a burlap sack.
4. An apology, handwritten in unicorn blood, for even DARING to think you can get away with your cheesy, joyful nonsense.

Consider this your only warning.

Mr. Grinch.
