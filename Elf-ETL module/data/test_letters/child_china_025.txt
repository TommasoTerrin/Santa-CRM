Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Lin, and I am 8 years old. I live in Shanghai with my Baba and Mama. I hope you are doing well at the North Pole! Are the reindeer getting excited for their big trip?

I've been trying really hard to be good this year. I know I sometimes argue with my little sister, Mei, but I always share my toys with her, even my special robot. And last week, when Mrs. Chen, our neighbor, dropped all her groceries, I helped her pick them all up. She said I was a very helpful young man!

For Christmas, I would really, really love a LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon. It looks so cool! Or maybe the newest version of the mobile game "Honor of Kings" skins (not sure if you can get that, but I heard you are magic!). If those are too hard to find, then maybe a new set of calligraphy brushes and ink. I want to practice writing even better.

Thank you for everything, Santa! I will leave out some dumplings and soy milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Merry Christmas!

Love,
Lin
