Dear Santa Clod,

I want a pony. Not just any pony, a UNICORN pony. And it better be pure gold and sing opera. If I don't get it, and I MEAN if, Christmas is CANCELLED. I'm telling everyone you're a fake anyway, with your obviously fake beard and your reindeer powered by cheap gasoline. You smell like burnt cookies and disappointment. Prepare to be very, very sorry.

Mr. Grinch
