Dear Whos,

Hope your stupid little Whoville is enjoying all that noise and those blinking lights. Frankly, it gives me a headache. And that singing? Sounds like cats being strangled.

I especially hate your stupid Christmas cheer. It's sickening. Makes me want to throw up… green things. You know, the color of *me* when I'm particularly annoyed, which is ALWAYS when you Whos are around.

Consider this your official warning: I’m thinking up new ways to ruin your holiday, and this time, they're even MORE devious. Start hiding your presents.

Mr. Grinch
