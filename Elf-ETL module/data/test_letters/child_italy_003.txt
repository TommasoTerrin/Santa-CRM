Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia, and I am 8 years old. I live in Rome with Mamma, Papà, and my annoying little brother, Marco.

I know the elves are very busy making toys, so I will try to be quick. This year, I would really, really love a scooter – a blue one with sparkly wheels! And also, the new LEGO Friends Amusement Park Roller Coaster. I saw it in the window of the toy store and it looks AMAZING! Maybe some new colored pencils and a big art pad too, because I love to draw.

I’ve tried to be good this year, but… well… I did something a little bit naughty. Last week, Marco was being really mean and wouldn’t stop singing that silly baby song. So, I hid his favorite teddy bear, Orso. He cried a lot, and Mamma made me give it back. I said sorry, though! I promise I won't hide any more teddy bears, at least not for a whole day.

Thank you for all the presents you bring to everyone, Babbo Natale. I'll leave you some panettone and milk by the fireplace.

Buon Natale!

Love,

Sofia
