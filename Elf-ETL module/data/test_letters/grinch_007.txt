Dear Santa (or should I say, Fatty Claus?),

Listen here, you overgrown elf. This year, I expect a mountain of roast beast (hold the Who-pudding, I hate the stuff) AND your entire reindeer team delivered to my doorstep by December 24th. If I see even ONE sprig of holly or hear a SINGLE carol within a ten-mile radius of my cave, I'm coming for your beard. Consider this your only warning. Also, your boots are hideous.

Mr. Grinch.
