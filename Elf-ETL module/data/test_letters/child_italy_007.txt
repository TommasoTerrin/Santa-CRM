Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia and I am 8 years old. I live in Rome with my Mamma, Papà, and my little brother, Marco.

I hope you are doing well at the North Pole and that the reindeer are practicing flying every day! We decorated our tree last week, and it looks very sparkly.

This year, I tried to be a good girl. I always try to help Mamma with the dishes after dinner, even if sometimes I accidentally drop a fork! Marco and I argue sometimes, especially when he takes my crayons without asking, but I always share my toys with him.

For Christmas, I would really love a new art set with lots of different colors, especially the shiny glitter ones. I also saw a doll with long, brown hair and a pretty dress in the shop window near the Piazza Navona, and I would love to have her. And maybe, if it’s not too much to ask, a subscription to Topolino magazine so I can read the comics every week.

Thank you, Babbo Natale! I will leave you some biscotti and a glass of milk under the tree for you.

Love,
Sofia
