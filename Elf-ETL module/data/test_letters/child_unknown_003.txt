Cher Père Noël,

My name is Amélie, and I am 8 years old. I live in France, in a little village near Lyon. I have been trying my best to be a good girl this year.

I really, really hope you can bring me three things. First, I would love a new art set with lots and lots of pastels! I like to draw the flowers in our garden and the mountains in the distance. Second, I would like a book about horses. I am learning to ride, and I want to know all about them. Finally, if it's not too much to ask, a small stuffed owl would be amazing. I saw one in a shop window, and it looked so soft and wise.

This year, I tried my best to help Maman around the house. I helped set the table every night, even when I didn't want to. And I mostly shared my toys with my little brother, Antoine, even though he sometimes breaks them! I did have one little slip-up, though. I took a cookie from the jar before dinner without asking. Maman was a little cross, but I apologized.

I hope you have a safe journey to France! We will leave you some pain au chocolat and milk by the fireplace.

Merci beaucoup, Père Noël!

Love,

Amélie
