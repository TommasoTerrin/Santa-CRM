Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Sofia, and I am 8 years old. I live in Rome with my Mamma, Papà, and my little brother, Luca. I hope you are doing well up there in the North Pole, and that the elves are working hard!

I've been trying to be very good this year, but… well, it's been a little difficult sometimes. Remember how Mamma made that delicious tiramisu for Zia Elena's birthday? I know I wasn't supposed to, but I ate a little bit when she wasn't looking. Okay, maybe it was a bigger bit than I should have. Luca told on me, of course! I promise I won't do it again... probably.

For Christmas, I would really, really love a Nintendo Switch, so I can play all the Mario games. Luca has one, but he never lets me play! And if it's not too much trouble, I would also like a big art set with lots of coloured pencils and paints. I love to draw, and Mamma says I'm pretty good. Oh, and maybe a pair of sparkly, pink roller skates? My friend Giulia got some, and they are so cool!

Thank you, Babbo Natale! I will leave out some panettone and milk for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Buon Natale!

Love,

Sofia
