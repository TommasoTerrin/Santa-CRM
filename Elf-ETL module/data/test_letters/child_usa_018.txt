Dear Santa,

My name is Leo, and I am 9 years old. I live in Ohio. I hope you are doing good at the North Pole with Mrs. Claus and all the elves. Is Rudolph's nose extra shiny this year?

I’ve been trying to be good. I helped my mom rake leaves in the yard, even though it was really cold and I wanted to play video games. And I didn’t even complain too much! I also helped my little sister, Lily, with her homework, even though she can be kind of annoying sometimes.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really like a Nintendo Switch OLED. All my friends have one and we could play Mario Kart together online. I would also like the new Lego Star Wars set, the one with the Millennium Falcon. It looks so cool! And maybe, if you have room in your sleigh, some new drawing pencils and a sketchbook. I really like to draw.

Thank you for everything you do, Santa. I will leave you some cookies and milk by the fireplace on Christmas Eve.

Love,
Leo
