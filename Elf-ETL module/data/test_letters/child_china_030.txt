Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Lin, and I am 8 years old. I live in Shanghai with my Mama, Baba, and my little brother, Wei.

I hope your reindeer are doing well, and Mrs. Claus is making lots of yummy cookies! Are the elves busy making toys? I’ve tried to be a good boy this year, but sometimes Wei pulls my hair and then I get a little bit angry. But mostly I try to be good.

This year, I helped Baba carry groceries from the market, even the heavy bag with the rice. And I always try to share my toys with Wei, even though he breaks them sometimes! I also got a good grade on my Chinese calligraphy test, Baba was very proud.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really like a LEGO Ninjago set, the one with the Fire Dragon. I saw it in the store and it looks amazing! If that is too expensive, maybe a new set of colored pencils? My old ones are all used up. And maybe a book about dinosaurs? I love dinosaurs!

Thank you, Santa Claus. I will leave out a bowl of dumplings for you and some milk for the reindeer.

Love,

Lin
