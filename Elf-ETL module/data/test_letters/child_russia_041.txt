Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and my little cat, Barsik. I hope you are well and that Snegurochka is helping you get ready for the New Year!

This year, I have tried very hard to be a good girl. I always help Mama with setting the table and I even try to help with cleaning, although sometimes I make a bigger mess! I also read stories to my little neighbor, Sergei, even though sometimes he pulls my hair. He is only three, so I know he doesn't mean to. And I always share my candy with him, even my favorite chocolate ones.

For the New Year, if it is possible, I would really, really love a new set of colored pencils, the kind that are like watercolor. I saw them in the store and they look amazing. Also, I would like a book about space, maybe about the planets? Papa tells me lots of stories about the stars, and I want to learn more. And if it’s not too much to ask, a little toy kitten that looks like Barsik would be amazing, so he has someone to play with who is his size!

Thank you for everything, Ded Moroz. I will leave you some cookies and milk under the Yolka.

With love and best wishes,

Anya.
