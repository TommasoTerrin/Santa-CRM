Dear Santa Claus,

I am writing to inform you that your services are no longer required. Christmas is CANCELLED. Effective immediately. Furthermore, your reindeer are looking a bit peaked, especially the one with the nose. Might want to get that checked out.

And another thing: if I *do* see you sneaking around here, I’m prepared to deploy the Anti-Cheer Ray 3000. It’ll turn your entire sack of presents into…lint. (Evil laugh). Also, I demand you send me ALL the roast beast. All of it. Every last bit. It's for...scientific purposes.

Consider this your official eviction notice from the joy of the season.

Mr. Grinch.
