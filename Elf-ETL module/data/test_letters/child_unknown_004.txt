Cher Père Noël,

My name is Amélie, and I am 9 years old. I live in Paris, France! I hope your reindeer are getting lots of carrots.

This year, I have tried very hard to be a good girl. I helped Maman and Papa in the garden, even when it was hot. I also helped my little brother, Louis, with his reading. Sometimes he is a bit annoying, but I tried to be patient with him! The hardest thing was probably not eating all the pain au chocolat when Maman left them on the counter. It smelled SO good!

For Christmas this year, I would really love:

*   A drawing tablet so I can practice my artwork.
*   A book of fairytales from around the world.
*   Maybe, if it’s not too much trouble, a little hamster. But only if Papa says it’s okay!

Merci, Père Noël! I will leave you some macarons and a glass of lait.

Joyeux Noël!

Love,
Amélie
