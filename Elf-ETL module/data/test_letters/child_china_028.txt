Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Meilin, and I am 8 years old. I live in Shanghai with my Baba and Mama and my very noisy hamster, Jiji.

I know it’s still November, but Mama says I need to write to you soon if I want to make sure you have enough time to make my presents! I have been trying to be good, but sometimes it is hard. Last week, I accidentally spilled my juice all over Baba’s important paperwork when I was trying to build a very tall tower. He wasn't very happy and said I had to help clean it up. It took a long time! I felt bad, and I tried to be extra helpful after that.

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a new set of watercolor paints. The ones I have are all dried up, and I want to paint a picture of Jiji eating his sunflower seeds. Also, I saw this amazing doll at the store, a princess with a long, sparkly blue dress! Her name is Ling, and I would love to have her. And maybe, if it’s not too much to ask, a book about space! I want to learn about all the planets.

I promise to try my best to be good for the rest of the year! I will help Mama with the dishes and try not to argue with my friend Xiaowei.

Thank you, Santa Claus!

Love,
Meilin
