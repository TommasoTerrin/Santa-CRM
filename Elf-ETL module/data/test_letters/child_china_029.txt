Dear Santa Claus,

My name is Lin, and I am 8 years old. I live in Shanghai with my Baba and Mama. I hope your reindeer are doing well and getting lots of carrots ready for Christmas!

This year, I have tried very hard to be good. I help Mama in the kitchen by washing the vegetables (even the ones that smell a little funny!) and I always finish my homework before playing. I even helped my grandma learn how to video call so she can see my baby cousin more easily. She was very happy and gave me a big hug!

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a new set of LEGOs. The police station one looks amazing! I also want a book about space, with lots of pictures of planets and stars. Oh, and maybe a new calligraphy set? My old one is running out of ink.

Thank you so much, Santa Claus! I will leave out some cookies and milk for you and some grass for the reindeer.

Love,

Lin
