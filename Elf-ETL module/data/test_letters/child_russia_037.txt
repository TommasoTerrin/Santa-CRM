Dear Ded Moroz,

My name is Anya, and I am 8 years old. I live in Moscow with my Mama, Papa, and my babushka. I hope you are getting ready for New Year's Eve! I know you have so many children to visit all over Russia, and even the whole world!

I have tried very hard to be a good girl this year. I always help Babushka in the kitchen, even when I'd rather be outside playing. And last week, my friend Misha lost his favorite mitten on the playground, and I helped him look for it until we finally found it under the slide! He was so happy, and it made me feel good too.

For New Year's, I would really, really love a few things. First, I would love a new set of colored pencils - the big box with one hundred colors! My old ones are all worn down. And, if it’s not too much to ask, I would also really like a toy kitten that meows and walks. Mama says we can't have a real kitten because we live in an apartment, but a toy one would be almost as good. Oh, and maybe some new ice skates? My feet have grown so much this year!

Thank you, Ded Moroz, for everything. I will leave you some kasha near the window, just like Mama always does!

Pozdravlyayu s Novim Godom! (Happy New Year!)

Love,
Anya
