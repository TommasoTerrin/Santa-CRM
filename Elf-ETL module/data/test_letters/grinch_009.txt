Dear Santa Clause (more like Santa *Claus*, you smelly old chimney sweep),

I'm writing to inform you that your services are no longer required this Christmas. Frankly, the whole operation is a disaster. The reindeer are probably shedding all over the place, the elves are clearly underpaid and resentful, and your "presents" are just mass-produced garbage.

Furthermore, I demand you deliver to *me* a solid gold Who-ville, a lifetime supply of roast beast (hold the Who-pudding, that's disgusting), and the deed to your entire North Pole operation. If these demands are not met IMMEDIATELY, I will personally climb down your precious chimney and replace all the stockings with old socks full of mothballs. Consider this your only warning.

Merry... Humbug!

Il Grinch.
