Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Lorenzo, and I'm 8 years old. I live in Rome with my Mamma and Papà and my annoying little sister, Sofia.

I hope you and the elves are having a good time getting ready for Christmas! I've been trying to be good this year, but sometimes it's hard. Like last week, Sofia was building a really tall tower with her blocks, and it was blocking the TV when I was trying to watch my favorite cartoon, "Gatto Boy." So, I may have... accidentally bumped into the table. The tower fell down, and Sofia cried. Mamma wasn't very happy. I said I was sorry, though!

For Christmas, I would really, really love a new Lego set, the one with the police station and the helicopter! I also want a Juventus football jersey, with Dybala's name on the back, even though he left! And maybe, just maybe, a new video game for my Nintendo Switch, like the new Super Mario one?

I promise I will try extra hard to be good from now on. I'll even share my panettone with Sofia (maybe).

Grazie Babbo Natale!

Love,
Lorenzo
