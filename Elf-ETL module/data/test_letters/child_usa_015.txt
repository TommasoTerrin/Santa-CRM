Dear Santa,

My name is Leo, and I'm 9 years old. I live in Ohio with my mom and dad and my grumpy cat, Mr. Whiskers.

I've been trying to be good this year, but it's been kinda hard. Like last week, I accidentally broke Mom's favorite vase when I was playing baseball in the house. She wasn't too happy, but I did clean up all the pieces, even the tiny ones. I even tried to glue it back together, but it didn't really work.

For Christmas, I would really, REALLY like a new Nintendo Switch. My friend, Max, has one, and we could play Mario Kart together. I would also love a Lego Star Wars set, maybe the Millennium Falcon? That one looks super cool. And maybe a new baseball glove? Mine has a big hole in it.

I promise to try even harder to be good next year. I'll try not to play baseball inside anymore.

Thank you, Santa!

Love,
Leo
