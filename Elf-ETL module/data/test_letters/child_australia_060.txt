Dear Santa,

My name is Matilda and I’m 8 years old. I live in Brisbane, and it’s getting really hot here already!

I’ve been a very good girl this year, I promise! I helped my little brother, Finn, learn to ride his scooter. He kept falling down and getting upset, but I held his hand and ran beside him until he got the hang of it. Now he scoots all the way to the park!

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a new art set. The one I have is getting a bit old and the colours aren't very bright anymore. I would like one that has lots of different coloured pencils and paints, maybe even some glitter!

I also really want the new LEGO Friends Amusement Park roller coaster. It looks so fun to build and then play with all the little LEGO people!

And maybe, just maybe, if you have room in your sleigh, I would love a pair of roller skates. I’ve been practicing on Finn’s scooter and I think I'm ready for skates!

Thank you, Santa! I'll leave out a sausage roll for you and some carrots for the reindeer.

Love,
Matilda
