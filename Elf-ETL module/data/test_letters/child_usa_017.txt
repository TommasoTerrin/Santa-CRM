Dear Santa,

My name is Leo and I am 8 years old. I live in Ohio. How are you doing up at the North Pole? Are the reindeer excited for Christmas?

I have been trying really hard to be good this year. I always make my bed, even when I don't want to. And yesterday, Mrs. Davison down the street dropped all her groceries and I helped her pick them all up and carry them inside for her. She said I was a very helpful young man!

For Christmas this year, I would really, really love a Nintendo Switch. All my friends have one and we could play together. I also want the new Lego Star Wars set with the Millennium Falcon. It looks super cool! And maybe some new markers because my old ones are all dried out.

Thank you for everything you do, Santa. I'll leave you some cookies and milk by the fireplace!

Love,
Leo
