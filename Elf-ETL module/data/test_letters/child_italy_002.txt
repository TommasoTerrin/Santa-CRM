Caro Babbo Natale,

My name is Marco and I'm 8 years old. I live in Rome with my Mamma, Papà, and Nonna. I hope the reindeer are doing well and that the elves are busy making lots of toys!

This year, I've tried my best to be good. It wasn't always easy, especially when my little cousin, Sofia, came to visit. She kept trying to play with my LEGO spaceship, the Galaxy Explorer! I really didn't want her to touch it because I just finished building it, but Mamma said I had to share. So, I let her play with the little astronaut minifigures, and I showed her how they could zoom around on the table. I think she liked that!

For Christmas this year, if it's possible, I would really, really love a new Nintendo Switch game, especially the new Pokémon one, Scarlet or Violet. I've been saving my allowance, but it's still not enough. Also, I would love a Juventus soccer jersey with Ronaldo's name and number, even though he doesn't play for them anymore, he's still my favourite! And maybe, just maybe, some coloured pencils for my drawing.

Thank you, Babbo Natale! I will leave you some Panettone and milk by the fireplace.

Buon Natale!

Love,

Marco
