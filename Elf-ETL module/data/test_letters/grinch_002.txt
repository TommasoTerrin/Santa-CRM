Dear Santa (if that's even your REAL name),

I'm writing to demand 5,000 pounds of Who-pudding, delivered IMMEDIATELY. And make sure it's the stale kind, the kind that tastes like sadness and regret. Also, your reindeer are ugly and probably have fleas.

Frankly, Christmas is a ridiculous sham. A giant, sparkly excuse for noise and merriment, which, as you KNOW, are my least favorite things. Therefore, I propose you just cancel the whole stupid holiday. Save yourself the trouble, and save me the excruciating pain of having to listen to those blasted carols.

Consider this your only warning. Next year, it's Whoville getting coal...and maybe a little green fuzz.

Sincerely (not really),

Mr. Grinch
